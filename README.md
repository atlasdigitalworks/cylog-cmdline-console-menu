# cylog-cmdline-console-menu
A simple Console based menu for easy access to Cylog Command-Line Utilities. Written so as to work for those who simply download &amp; unpack the '.zip' file from Cylog's website &amp; move it to their root directory (C:\), but can of course be edited to match up with whatever you rename the folder &amp; wherever you place it!!
